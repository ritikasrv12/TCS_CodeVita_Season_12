# TCS CodeVita Season 12 Solutions

This repository showcases my solutions for the TCS CodeVita Season 12 programming competition, including a range of problems from MockVita rounds.

## MockVita Problems

1. **VIP Cafe**
   - **Description:** Raj runs a cafe frequently visited by VIP customers, who place high-value orders. To ensure VIPs are prioritized without neglecting regular customers, Raj adopts a dynamic priority system that adjusts after each order is served. Given the current order queue, the task is to determine how many orders will be served before Raj's friend's order is processed.

2. **Best Bubble**
   - **Description:** The challenge is to determine the minimum number of swaps needed to transform an array into a "beautiful" array, sorted either in ascending or descending order. A solution is required to find the fewest swaps necessary to achieve this fully sorted state.

3. **Zero Count**
   - **Description:** Ashok and Anand debate the fruit selection process from rows of lemon (L) and mango (M) trees. They need to select three non-adjacent trees such that no two adjacent trees are of the same type. The task is to identify which row allows for more valid selections. If the input is invalid, return "Invalid input"; if both rows have equal valid selections, return "Draw".

4. **Weapon Boxes**
   - **Description:** In a military camp, boxes of weapons are delivered, each with varying weights, which signify the quantity of weapons inside. The commander cycles through the first N boxes, moving the lighter box to the end after comparisons, until one box remains unchanged for K consecutive cycles. The challenge is to calculate the labor cost, which is the sum of the weights of boxes excluding those with triangular numbers as weights.

5. **Orchard**
   - **Description:** Two friends compete to select rows of trees represented by strings of 'M' and 'L'. Each friend must select three non-adjacent trees, and the goal is to determine who has the maximum valid selections. The input string needs to be validated, and the winner is determined based on valid tree selections.
